It presents an exclusive opportunity to showcase the forefront of research, present compelling case studies, and exemplify the seamless fusion of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) within the realm of architecture and planning.</p> <p>By harnessing the power of geospatial data, this book exemplifies how remote sensing and GIS integration significantly influence the architectural design process, urban planning, and the pursuit of sustainable development. It serves as a beacon of knowledge, providing a global perspective on the integration of these ground-breaking technologies, with a particular emphasis on their profound impact on architecture.</p> <p>The book actively seeks contributions that capture diverse perspectives from around the world, both from established architectural powerhouses and burgeoning economies. By doing so, it aims to cultivate a rich tapestry of ideas, experiences, and best practices, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the global implications of remote sensing and GIS integration within architecture and planning.</p> <h3>Scope of the Book</h3> <p>The book’s global scope includes a wide range of topics such as smart architectural site analysis with remote sensing and GIS, disaster analysis and building design, BIM-GIS integration, urban planning, landscape architecture, road network planning, city livability evaluation, and much more. We encourage chapters that include real-world case studies and practical applications across various sites in the world to provide readers with valuable insights and examples.</p> <p>It will target students, researchers, and practitioners in the fields of architecture and planning, including civil engineers, professors, government authorities, remote sensing and GIS professionals, and others interested in exploring new technologies and bringing innovation to architectural and planning practices.</p> <h3>Submission and Indexing</h3> <p>To express your interest in contributing, we kindly request that you submit an abstract of your proposed chapter by July 10th, 2023, following the guidelines provided in the attached poster and abstract submission format. Once your abstract is accepted, we will provide you with the chapter format and further submission details by July 16th, 2023.</p> <p>Please note that this book publication offers a prestigious platform for your research work. It will be indexed in Scopus by the publisher and circulated worldwide through Taylor &amp; Francis’ extensive network and websites.</p> <h3>Important dates</h3> <ul> <li>10th July 2023: Abstract Submission Deadline</li> <li>16th July 2023: Abstract Acceptance/Rejection Info</li> <li>17th September 2023: Complete Chapter Submission Deadline</li> <li>1st October 2023: Chapter Acceptance/ Rejection Info</li> <li>3rd December 2023: Chapter Review Results and Corrections</li> <li>24th December 2023: Final Chapter Submission</li> </ul> <p><strong>Important Links:</strong></p> <blockquote><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371166560_International_Call_for_Authors_Book_Title_-_Smart_Buildings_and_Cities_with_Remote_Sensing_GIS" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Call for Authors Poster Link</strong></a></blockquote> <blockquote><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QC8cRIZOgm0TXGZbQM_1g4hmK1yC-x3i" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Abstract Template Download Link</strong></a></blockquote> <blockquote><a href="https://forms.gle/nBfkmi4jmEwbrXzG6" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Abstract Submission Link</strong></a></blockquote> <blockquote><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/rsgis-global-group" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Google group 1 — For Geospatial Enthusiasts</strong></a></blockquote> <blockquote><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/architecture-planning-enthusiasts" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Google Group 2 — For Architecture, Planning, and Civil Engineering Enthusiasts</strong></a></blockquote> <p>For more details, kindly see the <strong>poster and abstract submission format </strong>attached below.</p> <p>If you have any queries or require further information, please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:books.editors.rsgis@gmail.com"><strong>books.editors.rsgis@gmail.com</strong></a> with the subject line “<strong>Query</strong>.” We are more than happy to assist you throughout the submission process.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tdf0yXGWLZ1barBtMTSI-A.png"></figure> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*O6QTZgMJZ91IwfqVDc4K6g.png"></figure> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vGo0eCMS8rEJt7e43RpfVg.png"></figure> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B-6xGtQfr07Lz-IUZDloKw.png"></figure> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fUgXvel_3J6cAp6WXdMb4A.png"></figure> <p><strong>Follow me to stay updated on upcoming geospatial articles! 🔔</strong></p> <p>Thank you for reading. :)</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ba4a39b083f8" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
