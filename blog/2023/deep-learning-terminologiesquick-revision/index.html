These hidden layers are a crucial component of feedforward neural networks, including multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and deep neural networks (DNNs).</li> <li> <strong>Depth:</strong> The number of hidden layers in a neural network determines its depth. Networks with more hidden layers are referred to as “deep” networks. Deep neural networks are capable of learning hierarchical features and are often used in complex tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.</li> <li> <strong>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):</strong> Computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers to process and learn from data.</li> <li> <strong>Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):</strong> A type of artificial neural network with multiple layers of interconnected neurons, commonly used in various machine learning tasks.</li> <li> <strong>Convolution:</strong> A mathematical operation in CNNs that merges two sets of information.
