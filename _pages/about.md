Neha Sharma is a GeoAI and remote sensing enthusiast with an interdisciplinary foundation in architecture, geomatics, and data science. Currently a Product Engineer II - Geospatial Data Science at [ESRI’s](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) GeoAI R&D Center, Delhi, a global leader in mapping and spatial analytics, she specializes in developing innovative geospatial solutions for global challenges. Previously, she worked as a Software Engineer - GeoAI at [Larsen & Toubro](https://www.larsentoubro.com/)(L&T-NxT, Mindtree, [LTIMindtree](https://www.ltimindtree.com/)), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, contributing to transformative projects in one of India’s leading construction firms. 

She holds an MS in Data Science from [Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/), an M. Tech in Geomatics from [CEPT University](https://cept.ac.in/11/536/faculty-of-technology/master---s-in-geomatics), and a bachelor’s in architecture (B.Arch) from [MA-NIT, Bhopal](https://www.manit.ac.in/), a premier institute of national significance.

An academic gold medallist, Neha has co-edited the globally released Taylor & Francis book, [Smart Buildings and Cities with Remote Sensing and GIS (2025)](https://www.routledge.com/Smart-Buildings-and-Cities-with-Remote-Sensing-and-GIS/Mohan-Munoth-Sharma/p/book/9781032586113?srsltid=AfmBOoozHthPHVnxhlytd81CSfhZ8Q4ol0zhSXFF7deNity_cfwZlwxM)—a first-of-its-kind initiative bridging remote sensing and architecture as well as planning. She has co-authored multiple research publications in international and national conferences and journals. She has won prestigious awards such as the GICEA Gold Medal and hackathon accolades for her AI-driven geospatial solutions. Her interests encompass remote sensing, GIS, spatial data science/GeoAI, computer vision, and geospatial R&D. 

Neha is dedicated to continuous learning and professional development. She has earned the [Google Project Management Certificate](https://grow.google/intl/en_in/project-management-course/) and the [Scrum Master Certification (Scrum Alliance)](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified/scrum-master-track/certified-scrummaster), equipping her with skills in agile methodologies, project planning, and execution. 

Passionate about education and mentoring, Neha has trained 200+ students and professionals through workshops and programs bridging architecture, geospatial technologies, and AI. She co-organizes and serves as a subject matter expert for the National Level Online Training Program - GAP (Bridging the GAP between Geomatics, Architects, and Planners), an initiative led by the Council of Architecture – Training & Research Center (CoA-TRC) since 2020. She is also an active community volunteer with organizations like ISG, IEEE, and CEPT University. 

Neha Sharma envisions shaping the future of GeoAI and human-centered AI research. Her goal is to collaborate with global researchers, mentor emerging talent, and drive interdisciplinary innovations that transform geospatial data into actionable insights. She is passionate about addressing critical global challenges, particularly in urban resilience, environmental sustainability, and geospatial intelligence. Neha also seeks to bridge the gap between geospatial technologies, architecture, and planning, utilizing her expertise to create solutions that impact both the built environment and communities. She is dedicated to continuous learning, professional growth, and contributing to the global advancement of GeoAI.
