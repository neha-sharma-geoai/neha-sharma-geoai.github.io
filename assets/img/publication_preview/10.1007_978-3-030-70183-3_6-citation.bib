abstract="Purpose---Generation of `Spatial and Gridded Air Quality Index Model' using GIS to compute the AQI using the known ground data for the locations where there are no sensors at a selected grid size. The main objectives of the model are to integrate observations, to predict the unknown values and to make provision for future development without compromising with quality.",
